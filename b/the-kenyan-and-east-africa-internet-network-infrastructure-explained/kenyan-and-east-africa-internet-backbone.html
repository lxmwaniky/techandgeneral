                                East Africa as a whole has taken leaps in terms of technology. It has been 
                                 dubbed the silicon savannah. We are now very dependent on high-speed 
                                 internet connectivity. Businesses operate completely off the cloud. 
                                 Remote working is on the rise. Digital education has now become a 
                                 possibility with pilot programs underway. Streaming platforms which 
                                 are international, regional, and local the likes of Netflix, Hulu, 
                                 Showmax, and airtel tv are catching on. We depend on the web for 
                                 entertainment and Online gaming. Not to mention Kenyans are known 
                                 for their social media footprint #KOT. This in turn generates a lot 
                                 of traffic.</p>

                                 <p> The T.E.A.M.S cable was designed to have a capacity of 
                                 80Gb/s upgradable to 640Gb/s as a contingency. To put this in context
                                  8bits equal one byte,80Gigabits per second would mean a pipeline of 
                                  1 actual Gigabit per second.

                                  That's a lot of initial throughput, imagine the amount of system expansion. During the actual installation,
                                   the designed capacity of the system was increased to 1.2 Tb/s and 
                                   the initial capacity to 120 Gbit/s.

                                              The Kenya ICT authority implemented the
                                              National Optical Fibre Backbone (NOFBI). The project that
                                               was partially funded by the Chinese government and in its
                                                first phase aimed to connect all the 47 Kenyan counties
                                                 to the national Optical Fibre network. NOFBI Phase 1 is
                                                  already in use in the national government, and in firms
                                                   such as Telkom, my current ISP, Safaricom, Jamii Telecom,
                                                    and KENET, utilizing more than 3,000km of the cable.

                                NOFBI Phase 2 was to further increase the coverage and safety protection
                                 of the existing transmission network,(an extra layer of redundancy) 
                                 to enable the local government departments of the 47 counties to form 
                                 an efficient transmission network with the central government. The 
                                 construction of NOFBI Phase 2 began in September 2014.

                                   my three examples.
                                Let's track my request to the three websites and all their responses.
                                And as a disclaimer, I have shown my IP, don't try anything fishy :-)
                                The request goes through my default gateway, bouncing off the nearest
                                 base station(commonly known as boosters), and then gets into the shared 
                                 fiber network. A local mobile switching station directs it into internal 
                                 Telkom networks. Large data centers that are owned by Telkom are found in
                                  Eldoret. A few bounces in the network while trying to determine the best exit

                                   If the traffic is not inbound it is typically forwarded to the KIXP 
                                   (Kenya Internet Exchange Point). The Kenya Internet Exchange Point (KIXP) 
                                   is the facility that keeps Kenyan Internet traffic in Kenya. It allows Kenyan
                                    Internet Service Providers to easily exchange traffic within Kenya, without
                                     having to send those messages across multiple international hops to reach 
                                     their destination while improving connectivity and services for their customers.

                                     The KIXP and Internet exchange points are wide topics and need individual
                                       discussions later on. The concept of Internet exchange points is built
                                        around interconnecting internet service providers at one point and 
                                        utilizing dynamic routing techniques, exchanging traffic destined for
                                         local services providers connected to the exchange point locally without
                                          utilizing the expensive international link capacity. Before an IXP, 
                                          all inter-ISP traffic, both domestic and foreign bound must be exchanged 
                                          through exchanges outside the country. ISPs, therefore, send all outbound 
                                          traffic through their international links most commonly satellite and 
                                          occasionally submarine fiber(T.E.A.M.S and EASSY). International links
                                           entail both upstream and downstream packet traffic, the costs of which
                                            must be borne by either the sending or the receiving ISP.
                                With the presence of an IXP, domestic traffic is peered at the exchange point,
                                 freeing the international links from congestion, enhancing faster speeds of
                                  data, and reducing costs and delays.
                                KIXP is deeply integrated with the National Optical Fibre Network with 
                                all major ISPs peering. Our web request is exchanged between Telkom and 
                                Safaricom's networks. 
                                Safaricom's routing protocols follow the same 
                                scheme with some nodes occasionally in Isiolo(happens once in a while ). Note that this data/ 
                                request routing protocols are highly dynamic and change in a matter 
                                of seconds. Data packets will always follow the shortest and most 
                                efficient path to their destination. Paris-traceroute and legacy 
                                traceroute have different outputs, why? Several ISPs are known to 
                                make their routers stealth to traceroute in two ways: they either 
                                don't decrement TTL in IP packets (making themselves IP wormholes) 
                                or they don't respond to expired TTL while still forwarding ICMP
                                .(ping requests)The reason is to keep their internal network topology 
                                private. That's all. Issuing traceroutes from/to multiple sources/destination
                                 reveals information on network topology, which is something not everyone
                                  appreciates.<img src="../../assets/images/paris-traceroute-safaricom.png" alt="Paris-traceroute Techandgeneral">

                                 ii) Telephone House Data Centre

                                I have not been able to directly get the IP addresses of routers
                                 and servers from these sites but they sit on the edge of the Kenyan
                                  internet. Where we connect to the rest of the world, literally.

                                 1. Safe and secure connections to various members
                                 2. Peering opportunities with some of the biggest networks, CDNs, and carriers in the world.
                                 3. Reduced transit costs, localized traffic, and optimized routing paths.

                                So this means that that google search, youtube viral video, 
                                and your Facebook feed might not be served internationally 
                                from California, USA but cached in Mombasa. When we go even 
                                further, depending on where the cable is laid out, the cable 
                                coming in from the Indian ocean to the landing station might 
                                be advertised or not. Most of the time cable consortium companies 
                                try to hide the cable as much as they can so that only those 
                                who need to know – municipalities, port authorities, and shipping companies – 
                                are informed of the exact route of the cable. I don't see TG on the 
                                list but :-) the  cable lands on Mombasa island near the harbor.
                                The actual landing site.<img src="../../assets/images/T.E.A.M.S-landing-point-mombasa.png" alt="TEAMS cable landing point mombasa">

                                 go first through the United Arab Emirates. UAE-IX in Dubai is the
                                  largest carrier and data center-neutral Internet Exchange for the 
                                  Middle East and since T.E.A.M.S lands on Fujairah, UAE's beach I

                                    Then the traffic is most probably directed to the DE-CIX 
                                    which is the german version of KIXP (Deutscher Commercial 
                                    Internet Exchange) is the carrier- and data-center-neutral 
                                    internet exchange point (IXP) situated in Frankfurt, Germany. 
                                    Fun fact  (DE-CIX)is now the single largest exchange point
                                     worldwide in terms of average traffic throughput of 6.1 
                                     Tbit/s (terabits per second) in September 2020. So yeah it 
                                     handles most of European,middle-east, and by extension East
                                      Africa's upstream traffic. Both requests are then forwarded 
                                      to their respective web hosting servers and a response is 
                                      returned following the same path. Wow, that was a lot. 
                                      Network Junkies have made it this far ---laughing emoji---
                                      .Now keep in mind that all this happens in a matter of seconds
                                       if not milliseconds of you clicking a link requesting a webpage 
                                       or opening an app. Keep that in mind and use the internet 
                                       for good, like online gaming #PUBG. It always baffles me 
                                       how complex the internet is and how all these moving 
                                       parts fit together to give us the experience we have. 
                                       On the flip side, hops, paths, and routes have become 
                                       tougher to track. Even for network administrators who 
                                       do it for troubleshooting purposes. This is because of
                                        dynamic routing tables, router obfuscation, blocking 
                                        of high UDP ports, and load balancing routers. We sha
